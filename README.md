## Final LB position: 5th (macro-averaged f1 score: 0.5177)

Code solution for BioMed Datathon, an Inter-university Competition on Building AI Solutions for Medical Data Through Multi-Label Classification

- Hosted by mHealth Lab at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in collaboration with Aurora Consulting.

## Goal:
The goal of the BioMed Datathon is to foster collaboration and innovation in the field of healthcare AI. Participants are tasked with developing robust algorithms capable of accurately detecting various cardiac abnormalities solely from audio recordings. By advancing the state-of-the-art in AI-driven medical diagnostics, this competition aims to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and pave the way for a more efficient and accessible healthcare system.

## Dataset Description:
The BMD-HS dataset is a groundbreaking collection of heart sound recordings designed to improve automated cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis. With meticulous curation, it comprises 800+ recordings across five distinct classes, including common valvular diseases: Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), and Mitral Stenosis (MS). Notably, the dataset features multi-label annotations, allowing for nuanced disease classification and capturing unique disease states. Data acquisition efforts focused on ensuring gender balance and addressing class imbalance by collecting recordings from 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects for each valvular disease class. Recorded at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Dhaka, the dataset represents a diverse demographic, enhancing its relevance for healthcare in Bangladesh. Annotations follow a clear naming convention, indicating disease presence and severity, along with additional demographic information. The dataset encompasses both single and multi-valvular disease samples, providing a comprehensive representation of cardiac health states. With implications for both research and clinical practice, the BMD-HS dataset holds immense potential for advancing CVD diagnosis, particularly in underserved regions, and fostering the development of AI-based diagnostic tools.
